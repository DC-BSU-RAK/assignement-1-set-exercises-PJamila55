    <h2>Plot</h2>
    <p>Ford v Ferrari is more than just a racing movie; 
        it's a story about the complex relationship between two extraordinary men 
        and their battle against seemingly insurmountable odds.  
        
        At its core is the tale of Carroll Shelby, a Texan with a championship pedigree, 
        and Ken Miles, a fiercely talented but often difficult driver.  
        
        Tasked by a determined Henry Ford II to defeat Ferrari at Le Mans, 
        Shelby and Miles embark on a relentless journey to design and build a car 
        capable of challenging the Italian powerhouse.

        The film delves into the personal sacrifices, the corporate politics, 
        and the sheer grit required to compete at the highest levels of motorsport.  
        Shelby, a master manipulator and strategist, must navigate the pressures from 
        Ford's executives while managing the brilliant but uncompromising Miles.  
        
        Miles, in turn, must overcome his own rebellious nature and learn to trust Shelby in their pursuit of perfection.  
        Their shared passion for racing and their unwavering belief in their own abilities forge an unbreakable bond, 
        even as they face setbacks, betrayals, and the ever-present danger of the track.  
        The climax at Le Mans is not just a test of machine against machine, 
        but of the human spirit against its own limitations.</p>
